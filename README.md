I created **Tobe** as I wanted more control over my YouTube watching habits. A lot of time is spent watching YouTube videos. **Tobe** aims to provide people with an improved watching experience by adding features such as video filtering and channel creation, and removing YouTube design patterns (such as autoplay and recommendations) to minimize distraction.

### Installation and Setup
