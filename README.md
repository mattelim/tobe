**Tobe** pulls only videos of accounts that you have subscribed to and provides you with additional features to organize and filter them.

I created **Tobe** as I wanted more control over my YouTube watching habits. A lot of time is spent watching YouTube videos. **Tobe** aims to foster a healthier watching environment by adding features such as video filtering and channel creation, and removing certain YouTube design patterns (such as autoplay and recommendations) to minimize distraction.

### Features

#### Channel creation

Create channels by combining your subscriptions by theme. You can add 'include' and 'exclude' filters to specify the videos by title.

#### Set time limits

Set a daily time limit to keep track of how much time you have spent on **Tobe**.
